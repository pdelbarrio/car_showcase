# Explore Cars App

Explore Cars is a Next.js application that serves as a playground for practicing and improving various web development skills and best practices.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: The app utilizes semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.

- **CSS Naming Convention (BEM)**: I follow the Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming convention to maintain clean and maintainable CSS.

- **Headless UI Integration**: I've integrated UI components designed to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

- **RapidAPI Integration**: I fetch car data using the RapidAPI platform's API.

- **Reusable Components**: The app includes custom buttons and filters as reusable components to enhance code modularity.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used throughout the application for static typing and improved code reliability.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Certain pages utilize SSR for better performance and SEO optimization.

- **Advanced Queries**: I use advanced queries to fetch and display car data efficiently.

- **"Show More" Button**: Instead of traditional pagination, I use a "Show More" button to progressively load more car listings, providing a seamless user experience.
